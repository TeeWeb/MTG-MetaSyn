# MTG-Visualizer

## Overview (MVP)

A web app to display relationships between cards from Magic: The Gathering that (may) have positive synergy with each other based on card properties and the game mechanics that they interact with.

Users can enter search criteria (including colors, keywords, type, and sets) which is used to filter card data (provided by magicthegathering.io's API) and then display related cards. Search results are displayed in a 3D space with each card represented as an "orb", floating in a position determined by it's Color Identity (as defined in api.magicthegathering.io) and Converted Mana Cost as shown below.

When a card is selected by the user, the displayed "orbs" are filtered based upon their "synergy" with the selected card, leaving only "synergistic" cards.

The app is built in React and uses ThreeJS to display a 3D space in which the user can navigate through and examine the card results. The "cards" are rendered as orbs located at various points throughout the 3D scene, which will be positioned according to their relationship with each of the other "cards". This will give the user a visual reference for the amount of "synergy" between cards.

## Data Sources

This app uses data provided by the fine folks at Wizards.com and mtgjson.com

## Future Improvements

- Implement _Color_ filter functionality (currently not working)
- Implement _Keyword_ filter functionality (currently not working)
- Change ThreeJS _OrbitControls_ to _FlyControls_ (or similar variant) to improve UX
- Add 2+ color mana textures to orbs (currently only using single-color textures, forcing multicolor cards to be shown with only one of their colors as its texture).
- Redesign Plane component (i.e. add thematic texture(s), and possibly 3D models)
- Add ability to select multiple orbs at once for additional card analysis
- Add UI elements that display key synergy-related data about selected card(s)

### Decklist Import

In the future, could add a Decklist Import feature to allow users to upload decklists and have a visual reference for the relationships between the cards in their decks. This feature could also include a graph displaying the deck's Mana Curve and other deck information.

## Development Setup (Individual Processes)

### Frontend (ReactJS)

- Change directory to /app and setup frontend app: `cd ./app`
- Install dependencies: `yarn install`
- Start app: `yarn start`

### Server (Flask/Python)

- Change directory to /server and setup Python virtual environment: `cd ./server`
  - On MacOS/Linux:
    - `python3 -m venv venv`
    - `source venv/bin/activate`
  - On Windows:
    - `python -m venv venv`
    - `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Add a `config.yaml` file into the server/ directory. This file should contain the following key/value pairs, and should never be commited to git repo:
  - "mongodb_uri": <URL to MongoDB>
  - "username": <database username used to access MongoDB>
  - "pw": <database password>
- Start server: `flask run --host=localhost`

## Running the app with Docker

From the project's root directory, run:
- `docker-compose up --build`

This will build and run the three Docker containers: 
- Nginx (mtg-metasyn_nginx)
- ReactJS App (mtg-metasyn_app)
- Flask Server (mtg-metasyn_server)
## Production Setup

- Create production-ready build for frontend app:
  - `cd ./app`
  - `yarn build`
  - `cd ..`
- Migrate the 
  - `docker-compose up --build -d`
